    "The OFDM system starts with generation of random data symbols from 1 of 10 possible modulation schemes (BPSK to 1024 QAM), based on input provided from PYNQ. In accordance with the procedure used in the IEEE 802.11a/g standard, the symbols are grouped into blocks of 48 for mapping to sub-carriers. The OFDM symbol consists of 48 data sub-carriers, 4 pilot sub-carriers and 12 null sub-carriers (including DC). The final OFDM symbol is created by performing a 64 point IFFT and adding a 16 sample Cyclic Prefix (CP). The transmitted signal consists of a continuous stream of OFDM symbols. At the very beginning of the data stream, the L-STF and L-LTF training symbols from the IEEE 802.11a/g standard are transmitted, to aid synchronisation and channel estimation tasks in the receiver. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the receiver, timing and frequency synchronisation are performed to acquire symbol timing and correct for any frequency offsets. Once timing is achieved, the FFT is performed to recover the underlying data symbols in each OFDM symbol. The L-LTF symbols are used to estimate the channel frequency response at each sub-carrier position, which subsequently allows the data to be equalised. Finally, the pilot symbols are used to correct for residual phase errors in the phase tracking stage. The recovered symbols are then passed into the PS for visualisation in PYNQ."
