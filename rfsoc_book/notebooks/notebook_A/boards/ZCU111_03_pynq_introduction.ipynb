    "This notebook introduces Python Productivity on Zynq, which is commonly referred to as PYNQ. We begin by describing the PYNQ framework and listing useful documentation and online resources for you to explore. We will then introduce several libraries that are provided alongside PYNQ that are generally used to control and interface to the Programmable Logic (PL) portion of the RFSoC device. Lastly, we will investigate PYNQ Overlays, which are programmmable hardware configurations that are implemented on the PL. \n",

    "## 1. Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "PYNQ is often described as a software framework for Zynq-base embedded systems that can be conceived as a stack of layers, as shown in Figure 1. The layers include a Programmable Logic (PL) hardware system design, an Operating System (OS) layer, low-level drivers layer for interfacing to the hardware, a Python software layer, and a software application layer. The primary advantage of using PYNQ for embedded system development is that it provides a pre-configured software stack that is complemented by hardware libraries and reusable software components. It is also open-source!\n",
