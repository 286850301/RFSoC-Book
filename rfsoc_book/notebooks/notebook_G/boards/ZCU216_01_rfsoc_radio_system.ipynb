    "This demonstrator presents a Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) radio system design for the Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC [1]. The BPSK/QPSK radio implements a full transmitter and receiver design including frame based transmission of BPSK and QPSK modulated data, receiver synchronisation, frame synchronisation, and payload extraction. This demonstration employs the RFSoC RF Data Converters (RF DCs) to support the transmission and reception of BPSK and QPSK waveforms. This system is based on the work described in [2].\n",
